**An addon for the Dragonflight expansion. It will add icons for points of interest to the Pandaria world map.**

## Features

A quick toggle menu will appear on the Pandaria world map which allows you to quickly toggle the visibility of any icons added to the world map.

* Showing map icons both on the zone map and the world map helps with navigation for events with random locations

* Some icons provide access to additional UI with more important information when clicked

## Pins
