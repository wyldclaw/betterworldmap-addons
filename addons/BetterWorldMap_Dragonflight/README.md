**An addon for the Dragonflight expansion. It will add icons for points of interest to the Dragon Isles, Kalimdor, Eastern Kingdoms, Outland, and Northrend world maps.**

## Features

A quick toggle menu will appear on the Dragon Isles, Kalimdor, Eastern Kingdoms, Outland, and Northrend world maps which allows you to quickly toggle the visibility of any icons added to the world map.

* Showing map icons both on the zone map and the world map helps with navigation for events with random locations
* Many icons provide helpful information in the tooltip such as countdown times, reputation gains, rewards available, and more
* Some icons provide access to additional UI with more important information when clicked
