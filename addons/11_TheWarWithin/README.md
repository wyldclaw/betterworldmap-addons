**An addon for The War Within expansion. It will add icons for points of interest to the Khaz Algar world map.**

## Features

A quick toggle menu will appear on the Khaz Algar world map which allows you to quickly toggle the visibility of any icons added to the world map.

* Showing map icons both on the zone map and the world map helps with navigation for events with random locations
* Many icons provide helpful information in the tooltip such as countdown times, reputation gains, rewards available, and more
* Some icons provide access to additional UI with more important information when clicked
